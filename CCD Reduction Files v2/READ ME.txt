Important:
All python files named CCD.... are so called masterfiles.
masterfiles cannot be executed by themselves, you need
to write a subclass (the Fits....) which inherit them.
By changing the appropriate functions you can extend this
program to work on whatever filetype you want to.
All the python files use the Data object!
